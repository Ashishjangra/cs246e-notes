- `-` private
- `#` protected
- `+` public

<pre>
+-----+   m +-------+
| Car |◆--->| Motor |
+-----+   2 +-------+
</pre>

- "Owns-a" relationship (composition)
- Means the motor is part of the car
    - Does not have an independent exisitance
    - Copy/destroy the car => copy/destroy the motor (deep copies)
- Typical implementation - class composition, ie. object fields
- `m` on arrow indicates the name of the field
    - `class Car { Motor m; };`
- Number under arrow indicates how many fields

<pre>
+------+  0..*  +-------+
| Pond |◇------>| Ducks |
+------+        +-------+
</pre>

- "has-a" relationship (aggregation)
- Duck has its own independent existence
- Copy/destroy the pond =/=> copy/destroy the ducks
- Typical implementation: pointer field
- Ex. `class Pond { vector<Duck*> ducks; };`

The concept of _ownership_ is central to object oriented design in C++.

Every resource (memory, file, window) should be owned by an object that will release it (RAII). A unique pointer _owns_ the memory it points to. A raw pointer should be regarded as _not_ owning the memory it points.

If you need to point at the same object with several pointers, one pointer should own it and be a unique pointer. The rest should be raw pointers. Moving a unique pointer = transferring ownership.

If you need true shared ownership - we'll see later.

## Measures of Design Quality

- **Coupling**
    - How strongly different modules depend on each other
    - **Low:** 
        - Function calls with params/results of basic type 
        - Function calls with array/struct params
        - Modules affect each other's control flow
        - Modules share global data 
    - **High:**
        - Modules access each other's implementation (friends)
    - I can achieve perfect coupling by putting everything in one class, so there must be a balancing force
- **Cohesian**
    - How closely are the elements of a module related to each other
    - **Low:**
        - Arbitrary grouping (eg. `<utility>`)
        - Common theme, otherwise unrelated, maybe some common base code (eg. `<algorithm>`)
        - Elements manipulate state over the lifetime of an object
            - Ex. open/read/close files
        - Elements pass data to each other
    - **High:**
        - elements operate to perform exactly one task
    - I can achieve perfect cohesian by putting each method into its own class, but then they'll all depend on each other (high coupling).

- **High coupling**
    - Changes to a module affect other modules
    - Harder to reuse individual modules
    - Ex. `function whatIsIt(dynamic_cast)` tightly coupled to the `Book` hierachy, must change this function if you create another `Book` subclass
- **Low Cohesian**
    - Poor organized code, hard to understand and maintain
- We want high cohesian and low coupling

## SOLID principles of OO Design
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
    - A class should only have one reason to change
    - i.e. a class should do one thing, not several
    - Any change to the problem spec requires a change to the program
    - If changes to >= 2 different parts of the spec cause changes to the same class, SRP is violated
    - Ex. Don't let you (main) classes print things
        - Consider: 
        ```C++
        class ChessBoard {
            std::cout << "Your move"
        };
        ```
        - Bad design, inhibits code reuse
        - What if you want a version of your program that:
            - Communicates over different streams (file/network)
            - Works in another language?
            - Uses graphics instead of text?
        - Major changes to `ChessBoard` class, instead of reuse
        - Violates SRP, must change the class if there is any specification for:
            - Game rules
            - Strategy
            - Interface
            - Etc.
        - Low cohesian
        - Split these up
        - One modules (not main! can't reuse main) responsible for comunnication
            - If a class wants to say something, do it via parameters/results/exceptions
            - Pass info to communications object and let it do the talking
        - On the other hand - specifications that are unlikely to change may not need their own class - avoid needless complexity
            - Judgement call
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
    - Classes/modules/functions/etc. should be open for extension + closed for modification
    - Changes in a program's behaviour should happen by writing new code, not by changing old code
    - Ex.
        ```
        +-----------+     +---------+
        | Carpenter |◆--->| Handsaw |
        +-----------+     +---------+
        ```
        - What if a carpenter buys a table saw
        - This design is not open for extension (must change carpenter code)
        ```
        +-----------+     +-----+
        | Carpenter |◆--->| Saw |
        +-----------+     +-----+
                             ^
                             |
                    +--------+----------+
                    |                   |
               +---------+        +-----------+
               | Handsaw |        | Table Saw |
               +---------+        +-----------+
        ```
    - Also note: `countHeavy` function:
        ```C++
        int countHeavy(const vector<Book *> &v) {
            int count = 0;
            for (auto &p: v)
                if (p->heavy()) ++ count;
            return count;
        }
        ```
    - vs. `whatIsIt`, when we used dynamic casting (not closed for modiciation)
    - **Note:** can't really be 100% closed, some changes may require source modification
        - Plan for the _most likely_ changes and make your code closed with respect to those changes
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
    - Simply put: public inheritance must indicate an "IS-A" relationship
    - But there's more to it: If `B` is a subtype (subclass) of `A`, then we should be able to use an object `b` of type `B` in any context that requires an object of type `A` _without affecting the correctness of the program (*)_
    - C++'s inheritance rules already allow us to use subclass objects in place of superclass objects
    - (\*) Very important point: a program should "not be able to tell" if it is using a superclass object or a subclass object 
        - Formally: if an invariant `I` is true of class `A`, then it is true of class `B`
        - If an invariant `I` is true of method `A::f`, and `B::f` overrides `A::f`, then `I` must hold for `B::f`
        - If `A::f` has a precondition `P` and a postcondition `Q`, then `B::f` must have a precondition `P' <= P` and a post condition `Q' => Q`
        - If `A::f` and `B::f` behave differently, the difference in behaviour must fall within what is allowed by the program's correctness specification
    - Ex.
        1. **Contravariance Problem**
            - Arises anytime you have a binary operator (ie. a method with an "other" parameter) of the same type as `*this`
                ```C++
                class Shape {
                    public:
                        virtual bool operator==(const Shape &other) const;
                        ...
                };
                class Circle: public Shape {
                    public:
                        bool operator==(const Circle &other) const override; // (*)
                }
                ```
            - (\*) violates the Liskov Substitution
                - A `Circle` _is_ a `Shape`
                - A `Shape` can be compared with _any_ other `Shape`
                - Therefore a `Circle` can be compared with _any_ other `Shape`
                - C++ will flag this problem with a compiler error
                - **FIX:**
                    ```C++
                    bool Circle::operator==(const Shape &other) const {
                        if (typeid(other) != typeid(Circle)) return false;
                        const Circle &other = static_cast<const Circle &>(other);
                        // Compare fields of other with fields of *this;
                    }
                    ```
                - `dynamic_cast` vs `typeid`
                    - `dynamic_cast<Circle &>(other);`: is `other` a `Circle` or a subclass of `Circle`
                    - `typeid(other) == typeid(Circle)`: is `other` percisely a `Circle`?
                    - `typeid` returns an object of type `typeinfo`
        1. Is a square a rectangle?
            - A square has all the properties of a rectangle
                ```C++
                class Rectangle {
                    private:
                        int length, width;
                    public:
                        Rectangle(___);
                        int getLength() const;
                        virtual void setLength(int);
                        int getWidth() const;
                        virtual void setWidth(int);
                        int area() const { return length * width; }
                };
                ```
                ```C++
                class Square: public Rectangle {
                    public:
                        Square(int side): Rectangle(side, side) {}
                        void setLegnth(int l) override {
                            Rectangle::setLength(l);
                            Rectangle::setWidth(l);
                            // length == width in a square
                        }
                        void setWidth(int w) { ... } // Simiar
                };
                ```
                ```C++
                int f(Rectangle &r) {
                    r.setLength(10);
                    r.setWidth(20);
                    return r.area();  // Expect 200
                }
                ```
                ```C++
                Square s{1};
                f(s);   // 400
                ```
            - `Rectangle`s have the property that their length and width can vary independently; `Square`s do not. So this violates LSP
            - On the other hand, an immutable `Square` could substitute for an immutable `Rectangle`
            - What can be done:

        - Constraining what subclasses can do:
            ```C++
            class Turtle {
                public:
                    virtual void draw() = 0;
            };
            ```
            ```C++
            class RedTurtle: public Turtle {
                public:
                    void draw() override {
                        drawHead();
                        drawRedShell();
                        drawFeet();
                    }
            };
            ```
            ```C++
            class GreenTurtle: public Turtle {
                public:
                    void draw() override {
                        drawHead();
                        drawGreenShell();
                        drawFeet();
                    }
            };    
            ```
        - Code duplication!
        - How can we ensure that overrides of `draw()` will always do these things?
            ```C++
            class Turtle {
                public:
                    void draw() {
                        drawHead()
                        drawShell();
                        drawFeet();
                    }
                private:
                    void drawHead();
                    virtual void drawShell() = 0;
                    void drawFeet();
            };
            ```
            ```C++
            class RedTurtle: public Turtle {
                void drawShell() override { ... };
            };
            ```
            ```C++
            class GreenTurtle: public Turtle {
                void drawShell() override { ... };
            };
            ```
        - Subclasses cannot control the steps of drawing a turtle, not the drawing of head + feet
        - Can only control the drawing of a shell (called the **Template Method Pattern**)
    - Extension: **Non-Virtual Interface (NVI) Idiom**
        - `public virtual` methods are simultaneously:
            - Part of a class' interface
                - Pre/post conditions
                - Respect invariants
            - "Hooks" for customizations by subclasses, overriding code could be anything
        - All virtual methods should be private
        - All public methods should be non-virtual
        - Ex. Non-NVI class
            ```C++
            class DigitalMedia {
                public:
                    virtual void play() = 0;
            };
            ```
        - Now with NVI
            ```C++
            class DigitalMedia {
                public:
                    void play() {
                        doPlay();
                    }
                private:
                    virtual void doPlay() = 0;
            };
            ```
            - In the future, can add before/after code
                - Ex. call `checkCopyright()` before, call `updatePlayCount()` afterwards
        - Generalizes the Template Method Pattern
        - Puts every virtual method function inside a template method
- **Interface Segregation Principle**
    - Many small interfaces is better than one large interface
    - If a class has many functionalities, each client of the class should only see the functionality that it needs
    - Ex. Video Game (will ignore NVI to keep example short)
        ```C++
        class Enemy {
            public:
                virtual void strike();  // Needed by game logic
                virtual void draw();    // Needed by UI'
        };
        ``` 
        ```C++
        class UI {
            vector<Enemy *> v;
        };
        ```
        ```C++
        class Battlefield {
            vector<Enemy *> v;
        };  
        ```
        - If we need to change the drawing interface, `Battlefield` must recompile for no reason
        - Creates needless coupling between `UI` and `Battlefield`
        - One solution: **Multiple Inheritance**
        ```C++
        class Enemy: public Draw, public Combat {};
        ```
        ```C++
        class Draw {
            public:
                virtual void draw() = 0;
        };
        ```
        ```C++
        class UI {
            vector<Draw *> v;
        };
        ```
        ```C++
        class Combat {
            public:
                virtual void strike() = 0;
        }
        ```
        ```C++
        class Battlefield {
            vector<Combat *> v;
        }
        ```
        - Example of the **Adapter Pattern**
    - General use of the Adapter Pattern: when a class provides an interface different from the one you need
    - Ex.
        ```
        +------------------+        +----------------+
        | Needed Interface |        | Provided Class |
        +------------------+        +----------------+
        |+ g()             |        |+ f()           |
        +------------------+        +----------------+
                 ^                          ^   
                 |                          |   // This inheritanc couole be private, 
                 +-------------+------------+   // depends on whether you want the adapter 
                               |                // to still support the old interfacec
                           +---------+
                           | Adapter |
                           +---------+    +----------+
                           |+ g() ---|----| { f(); } |  // Show's implementation
                           +---------+    +----------+
        ```

                 +-----+
        ```
        ```
                 +-----+
                 |  A  |

           +--------+--------+

        +-----+           +-----+
           |                 |
           +--------+--------+
                    |
                 +-----+        
                 |  D  |    // Has two a() methods, and they're different
                 +-----+        
        ```
        ```C++
        class D: public B, public C {
            void f() { ... a() ... }  // Ambiguous, use B::a() or C::a()
        };
        D d;    
        d.a();  // Ambiguous, use d.B::a() or d.C::a()
        ```
    - OR maybe there should be only one `A` base, and therefore only one `a()`
        ```C++
        class B: virtual public A { ... };
        class C: virtual public A { ... };
        ```
    - Now `d.a()` is no longer ambiguous
    - Ex. iostream hiearchy
    ```
                            ios_base
                               |
                               |
                       .------ios-----.
                      /                \
                     /                  \
                    /                    \
                   /                      \
               istream                  ostream----ofstream
              /       \                   /    \ 
             /         \                 /      ostringstream
            /           \              iostream
           /             \                |    \
          /               \               |     \
         /                 \              |      \
     ifstream       iostringstream      fstream  stringstream    
    ```
    - _Problem:_ How will a class like `D` be laid out in memory (implementation specific)
        - Consider:
        ```C++
        +----------+    <-- Should look like an A*, B*, C*, D*
        |   vptr   |      
        +----------+
        | A fields |
        +----------+
        | B fields |
        +----------+
        | C fields |
        +----------+
        | D fields |
        +----------+          
        ```
    - What does `g++` do?
        ```C++
        +----------+
        |   vptr   |
        +----------+
        | B fields |
        +----------+
        |   vptr   |
        +----------+
        | C fields |
        +----------+
        |   vptr   |
        +----------+
        | D fields |
        +----------+
        |   vptr   |
        +----------+
        | A fields |
        +----------+
        ```
